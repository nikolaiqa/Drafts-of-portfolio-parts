# About 
This time I'm about to present one of my collections from Postman, which is extremely special to me because it was my first one. Funny fact: at the very begining I wanted to create it the way how it looks right now, but I couldn't manage it due to I didn't know how to write JSON-code correctly. So I had slighty to learn JS (that took some time, of course) and now I'am able to introduce it for you
